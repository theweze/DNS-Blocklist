# DNS-Blocklist
The domains on this list have been cobbled together from the list of blocked domains on PiHole from my iPhone. It is intended to be lightweight and geared towards
on device dns filters on mobile devices such as AdGuard for a balance between privacy and battery life. I will personally use this list when i'm not connected to
my home network as I do not feel like setting up a vpn for pihole and would rather just exclude my home wifi network from filtering in AdGuard for iOS's settings
and use this filter for all other networks outside of my home. I will add domains as I discover them. I plan to update this list atleast once a week.

contains some ad and tracking domains found in Apple's iOS, various mobile apps, and websites. This list will be ever expanding
